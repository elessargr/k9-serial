# k9-serial
Windows USB Serial port finder which automatically opens putty in the end.

This is a small script that I have written to locate easily the USB to serial cable that have been plugged to your windows laptop.

Once the K9-Serial have been run (as a script or an exe file) because it has located the COMx port its giving the choose to open putty with pre-configured bautrates to make your line of work easier.

Feel free to commit new features to this scripts which you think can be useful to someone else.

Enjoy!


Before you ran it:

Make sure you have configured the config.txt file with the location of the putty.exe.
Note that the folder needs to be in C:\Python\K9-Serial\
